It was upon a silent and restless evening that Mr. Utterson found himself once more beneath the shadowed door. The wind rattled through the narrow alleys of Soho, whispering secrets in the darkness. Fog clung to the cobblestones like a damp shroud, and every footfall echoed like a judgment.

He paused, as he always did, staring at the worn wood and iron latch. The handle felt colder than usual, as though some presence within had sensed his return. A thin trace of light slipped through the crack at the threshold, flickering, as if disturbed by movement just beyond the door.

With breath held and heart heavy, he knocked.

No answer.

Again, he struck the door, more firmly this time. Still no reply — only the distant sound of a clock chiming seven from somewhere deep within the city.

Suddenly, the light within extinguished. A footstep sounded, quick and soft. Then silence.

Mr. Utterson stood there for several minutes, uncertain whether to flee or force entry. But something stronger than fear rooted him in place — perhaps loyalty, perhaps guilt.

He turned away at last, the chill of the night settling deeper into his bones, and walked back into the mist, never knowing how close he had come to seeing the truth behind the shadowed door.
